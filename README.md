Notes from learning Haskell

Currently, this is all definitions. Some definitions are copied straight from the book [Haskell Programming from first principles](https://haskellbook.com/). Some are enhanced with information from other sources or have text that is my personal interpretation. Because enhanced definitions reflect my understanding of Haskell and I am a beginner, they may not be fully correct.


**Status:** All definitions throught chapter 6.
