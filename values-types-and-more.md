- All computations are done via evaluation of expresstions






Typing
- association of a value with its type


Types
- Intuitively, we can thing of types as sets of values
- are not 'first class'
- describe values





Expression(s)
- Are syntatic terms
- Denote values
- Examples
  - integer `5`, character `'a'`, function `\x -> x + 1`, list `[1, 2, 3]` and tuple `('b', 4)`

Values
- abstract entities that we regard as answers
- every value has an associated type
- are 'first class'

Type expressions
- Syntatic terms that denote type values (or just types)
- Examples
  - `Integer`, `Char`, `Integer -> Integer` (a function maping `Integer` to `Integer`, `[Integer]`, `(Char, Integer)`

_First class_: Things that
- may be passed as arguments to functions
- returned as results
- placed in data structures
- and more ??
